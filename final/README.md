# Your Project Title Here

A small interactive experience (or a little experimental game) with simply gesture control, probably with yolo.

## Summary

It will be a good opportunity to learn how to do some simple video processing and create a visualization of it. Gesture control has potential to make simply games become really fun to play, and even more fun to watch others play.

I'll need to find the right library to use, learn how to use it, and design the game around it.
