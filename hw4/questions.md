# Answering questions from hw4
## Part 1:
1. How many lines are drawn each frame? In other words, how often does the for loop run?  
**All the lines are drawn onece per every frame. So 38 lines in total.**  
2. What do the first, second, and third appearances of the number 10 do in the code?  
**The first "10" is the x coordinate of the starting point, it's 10px from the left boundary. The secound "10" is found in "width-10" which evaluates to 390. That's the upper bound limit of x coordinates of the lines, which could not be reached. It explained why there're only 38 lines. The third "10" is the increament for x coordinate of the lines. It defines the gap between adjacent lines.**
